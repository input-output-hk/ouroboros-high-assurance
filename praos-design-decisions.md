# Design decisions of the Praos specification

The purpose of this document is to record the design decisions that
were made during the development of the current version of the
[**Ouroboros Praos**](https://eprint.iacr.org/2017/573.pdf) protocol
specification formalized in Isabelle/HOL. In particular, it is reported
what aspects were modeled (and how) and what aspects were left out.
